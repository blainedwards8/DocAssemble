Let's start moving components into the +page.svelte.ts file to clean up the +page.svelte file. If needed let's create a new class component to handle the logic.

I would like to implement the new document button. When the user clicks on a button to create a new document. A modal should be brought up with the available templates. The user can search for a template. The user will select a template and then user will click a "Create Document" button. The modal should close and the user should be redirected to the editor page for the new document. The new document should be created in the current matter. The new document should be created with the same title as the template. The new document should be created with the same content as the template. The new document should be created with the same state as the template. The new document should be created with the same description as the template.
